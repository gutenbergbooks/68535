pretty any more.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span> (<span class="italic">sitting beside her</span>): But you are,
Nell—pretty as a fair-day.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Nell</span>: A girl wants ribbons and laces and all
that. Look at my frock—why, the quality’s
serving women would laugh at it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Their ignorant pride, Nell. I don’t
laugh at it—I think it’s like a queen’s dress—you
make it look like that. I thought that
the first day, barley-gleaning—you remember?
The way you walked, and then stooping—willow
rods and birds’ wings and the way
a star falls. What’s a dress to all that, my
dearie?</p>

You’ll not be the judge, minister, there’s hope
in that. And the lasses are here, and a man’s
heart beats, and you can’t frown us out of it,
minister. Look at us, labouring and wearing
ourselves and near starving often, and are we
to take nothing that bright eyes and fond lips
and white young arms may offer? Who talks

Holy Willie there maybe has the truth of it,

<p>I must mend, indeed, indeed. And they are
lovely, but deceivers—so positive and sly—deceivers—I’ll
forswear them. I’ll be a
monk, and none but John Barleycorn for
merry company. Holy Willie is a bad man,
but he spoke truth I fear, though by rule of
the Kirk’s thumb. Forswear them, Robin.</p>

is Scotland’s king, and shall be so for ever!
Fill up! There’s a pretty Nell. How’s that
for a song, landlord?</p>

<p><span class="italic">The Landlord</span>: Very good sentiments,
Robin. Let all honest men prosper, say I.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Meaning, most noble landlord, all
honest men to be John Barleycorn’s liege subjects—that
pay tribute, mark you. Drink
up, Tam Laurie—why so doomsday, man?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Tam</span> (<span class="italic">a meek, hard-driven little man</span>): It’s
the cursed factors, Robin. They’ll not let a
man scrape supper gruel from his toil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Blast and misfortune to them!
Craft and fat bellies—a flea on a dog’s tail
is a respectable work of God beside a factor.
A toast, friends, fellow-citizens of Mauchline—‘To
hell with all factors.’</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[<span class="italic">The toast is drunk with enthusiasm.</span>]<br />
</p>

<p><span class="italic">A lean but well-to-do Farmer</span>: That’s all
very well, but rents have to be paid.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Friends—another toast—‘To hell
with all rents.’</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[<span class="italic">And again.</span>]<br />
</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Michael, you speak as a man the
Lord prospers.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Michael</span>: I speak as one who is diligent.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Diligent, quotha! A man left a fat
inheritance and his croft all favoured by
nature, and he talks diligence. Have you
sweated, Michael, with your share always
ringing on the stones, and your breeches letting
in the cold blast behind you, and your
boots full of March rain, and your belly
empty, and a bare table to go home to when
dark comes, and a gap in the roof above you
as wide as a lassie’s embrace? Have you done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
these things, and kept the heart true steel
within you, like Tam Laurie there?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Tam</span>: I’ve to quit come Tuesday week.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: To quit, Michael—do you hear
that? Do you know what quitting means?
You stand out there under the sky, and your
steps may as well go this way as that, for you
have no door in the world, and a ditch to
starve in is all you can borrow. And rents
must be paid. To hell with such rents I
say!</p>

<p><span class="italic">Michael</span>: I’ll not listen to such heresies in
the state. Respectable houses are not safe
when tongues are loose like this. But the
Lord will look to his own.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: You put off settlement with the
Lord as long as you can, Michael Johnson—you’ll
be wise.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Michael</span>: They say that Mr. Armour will
not be put off, though.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Burns</span> <span class="italic">is suddenly silenced by this, and

Thank you, Robin, for speaking.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Nell</span>: What’s that about Mr. Armour?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: They’ve beaten me, Nell. I’ve got
to go.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span> (<span class="italic">sitting at a table near to us, in dejection.</span>
<span class="smcap">Nell</span> <span class="italic">comes to him, still working. Some

We were friends, Nell, you and I.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Parnassus Hill, you remember?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Nell</span>: You and I, and love, and John
Barleycorn—yes.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Then there was my Mary; she died.
Then Jean came. You didn’t scold.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Nell</span>: I knew they would come. I told you I
was not for wedding.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Jean is a mother.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Nell</span>: You?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Nell</span>: You’ll wed her then, so why grieve?
She’s good, and she’s comely.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: I love her, Nell, and I’d be proud of
her. But I’m not to wed her.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Nell</span>: But that’s not honest, Robin.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: They won’t let me.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Nell</span>: Who won’t?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: That’s what Michael meant. Mr.
Armour. He’s forbidden it. I’m not genteel
enough. He says I’m profligate. He’s right I
dare say. But that, it’s bitter, that. He’d
rather have his girl be shamed alone than be
shamed by wedding me. And I can’t pay as
I’m ordered (<span class="italic">he shows her a paper</span>), so it’s jail
or leaving Scotland. John Barleycorn is all
now. Fill my pot, Nell.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[<span class="smcap">Nell</span> <span class="italic">does so, and brings it to him</span>.]<br />
</p>

<p><span class="italic">Nell</span>: What will you do?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Armour</span>: I will not. I want no creeping

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: That’s—I’ll not say what it is, Mr.

proud of it, if you would let us be.</p>

The girl’s a scandal to my name, but she’s not

<p><span class="italic">Holy Willie</span>: I told you of this, young man.
I preached the light to you.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Good counsel from you would corrupt
the saints, minister. Why won’t you let
me wed Jean, Mr. Armour?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Armour</span>: I came to give no reasons, Robert
Burns. I came to see you knew the choice
rightly. You can pay, or you can feel handcuffs,
or you can go where you’ll never offend
honest Scots eyes with the sight of you more.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Holy Willie</span>: And whichever you choose,
you’ll first do penance in kirk for an incontinent

it in good faith, let me take Jean to church.
There’ll be no penance in that, but hope and

Master Factor, a thing that makes old Nickie-ben
laugh down among the sulphur the minister
is so fond of gabbing about. And before
I’m gone, I’ll stand up and prophesy among
you. Mr. Armour, you’re a little man, in a
little place, and for your peddling bit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
dignity and self-esteem you’ll break your
girl’s heart and ruin me. Minister, you’ll sit
on the Lord’s right hand till He turns round
and catches you there. And you, Factor, will
sit on a lord’s right hand till he turns round
and finds your fingers in his pocket. And
you’re all upright pillars of repute, praise the
Lord, Amen. And Tam here is a pauper, and
I’m forfeit, and before the God that you
blaspheme with your devil’s work, we’ll take
our chance at the day of judgment against the
lot of you. He’ll have mercy on us, for we are
sinners, but I doubt he’ll take no notice of
you at all, and you’ll find it a wide place to
wander in and learn your lesson.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="italic">At</span> <span class="smcap">Professor Ferguson’s</span> <span class="italic">house in Edinburgh,
nearly a year later—in February</span>.</p>

<p><span class="italic">It is a cheerful, comfortable room, marked by the
taste and culture of Edinburgh literary
society at its best, with the elegance of
fashion. A few portraits of Scots men of
letters and action hang on the wall—Allan
Ramsay, Robert Fergusson, James
VI., Robert Bruce; in addition there are
books and a pair or two of claymores, and
two or three prints, including one by
Bunbury of a dead soldier and his dog.
On the mantelpiece is a bust of David
Hume. The chill Scots winter day is
brightened by a large fire in the grate;
outside is snow.</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Folding doors are open to a room beyond, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
a luncheon party has been taking place.
The ladies have left the table, and are
seated round the room before us. They are
the hostess</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Ferguson</span>, <span class="italic">the</span> <span class="smcap">Duchess
of Gordon</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Montgomery</span>, <span class="smcap">Miss
Taylor</span>, <span class="italic">and with them a boy of fifteen,
the young</span> <span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>. <span class="italic">Men’s voices
can be heard from time to time.</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Another lady, young and beautiful</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Stewart of Stair</span>, <span class="italic">is seated at the piano,
singing to her own accompaniment</span>.</p>

<p><span class="italic">The Duchess</span>: Bravo! A very beautiful

<p><span class="italic">Miss Taylor</span> (<span class="italic">very fashionable, rather plain,

he gave it to you?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Miss Taylor</span>: Rather indelicate, don’t you

rather embarrassed myself.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Ferguson</span> (<span class="italic">benign and easy, the professor’s
wife</span>): I like that tune so much—Afton
Water, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Stewart</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ferguson</span>: Jamie used to whistle it, I
remember.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Montgomery</span> (<span class="italic">marble, more the duchess

Ferguson, your young lion behaves himself
quite prettily.</p>

<p><span class="italic">The Duchess</span>: Why shouldn’t he, Mrs.
Montgomery?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Montgomery</span>: Oh well, Duchess, you
would hardly expect it from a ploughman,
now would you?</p>

<p><span class="italic">The Duchess</span>: ‘Flow gently, sweet Afton!
among thy green braes’—wouldn’t you expect
it of that?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: His conversation is entrancing.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Miss Taylor</span>: A very dangerous young man,
and with those eyes too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">The Duchess</span>: Nonsense, Martha. You
needn’t alarm yourself.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Miss Taylor</span>: Well, I shouldn’t like to be
alone with him.</p>

<p><span class="italic">The Duchess</span>: I am sure he would be discreet.
I think you’re a very lucky woman,
Mrs. Stewart. I wish Mr. Burns would write
poems to me. My husband says there’s never
been such a natural genius in Scotland before.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Montgomery</span>: Oh, come now. For an
uncultivated talent it is pretty well, we may
allow. But we must not turn his head.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Miss Taylor</span>: I entirely agree with you,
Mrs. Montgomery. Most unsafe.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: I wonder he hasn’t married.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Montgomery</span>: Oh, my dear, haven’t
you heard of the scandal in his own village?
It would have been jail I’m told if it hadn’t
been for some Mr. Gavin Hamilton who took
a fancy to him. But I believe he has several
families.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Miss Taylor</span>: I really don’t think we ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
to encourage him. And one of his poems, I
hear, is quite friendly to the Devil.</p>

mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="italic">The Duchess</span>: It’s that foolish man Robertson.
He was speaking ill of Mr. Gray’s <cite>Elegy</cite>.
He was very provoking. Mr. Burns does
quite right to defend it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns’s voice</span> (<span class="italic">from the far room</span>): Sir, I now

<p>[<span class="italic">The</span> <span class="smcap">Reverend Mr. Robertson</span>, <span class="italic">a pedantic

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Will you allow me, sir, to apologise?
I withdraw my observation, and you may call

<p><span class="italic">Ferguson</span>: May I add my word—</p>

<p><span class="italic">Muir</span> (<span class="italic">immensely pleased with the incident</span>):
Yes, but a damned blockhead. That’s
straight riding, you must allow that, sir.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Robertson</span>: I regret, your lordship, I am no
Nimrod.</p>

a straight line. I like the lad.</p>

great honour in your singing.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: The songs are their own recommendation,
Mr. Burns.</p>

they could not fail.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span> (<span class="italic">touching the piano very lightly
to the air of ‘Afton Water’</span>): Do you find Edinburgh
agreeable?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Some moments of it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Fortunately it does not deceive
me.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: But you have the sincere interest
of many.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: There are not many whose interest
is valuable. With most, I please for a season—a
new fashion in the window.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: A poet must not be bitter,
Mr. Burns.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: I am not bitter, madam. I know my
friends from the rest, that is all.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: Your friends should be happy.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: You are very gracious. You forget
the—condescensions.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: But that would be impossible.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Believe me, it is common. My
plough lends a virtue to flattery.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: There is honest esteem as
well—delight.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: I am as sensitive to it, madam, as
the top leaves to the last ripple of evening
wind. You are bountiful.</p>

<p><span class="italic">The Duchess</span> (<span class="italic">speaking across</span>): Mrs. Ferguson,
do you think we might ask Mr. Burns to
sing one of his songs himself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Ferguson</span>: If he would be so kind.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Madam, if her Grace so compliments
me. Will Mrs. Stewart play an air for
me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: You are happy there?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: I am free. And nobody patronises
me.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: But they have been very
civil to you here.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Some of them. And there have been
consolations even beyond that. The old man,
and the boy, and you. But the others—you
heard. Why should I? Where does it lead
me?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: Success at the Barley Sheaf is
more gratifying?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: I know, madam, I know. But I
shall never learn discipline.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: Not even for the sake of your
friends?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: In a few weeks I shall have passed
out of all this—back from it, if you will. My
friends, who will they be then? I do not expect
remembrance.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: That is not kind.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: It is generous of you to think it. O,
I am not ungrateful, believe me. I have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
fortunate in opinions that I shall cherish.
But those—with their vineyards, and
preachments over me, and Akensides, and
Wilson’s bookshop—did you hear that? My
time may come, but it is not now, in Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: And so birthright may be
wasted, at the Barley Sheaf?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Do not let me deceive you, madam.
Like my songs—yes, I pray you will do that.
But they thrive in that company—I am at
home there. I am not proud of it, and it will
settle my account early, likely enough. But
I know my condition. Virtue was born a
caprice in me, madam, and fortune has not
husbanded her for me. I sing sometimes, and
for the rest I have no talent, perhaps, but a
little to know myself.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Stewart</span>: I understand. And you will
be yourself.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Even through disaster, I must. It is
the only honour I have.</p>

<p>[<span class="italic">The</span> <span class="smcap">Fergusons</span> <span class="italic">come back</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="italic">Ogilvie</span>: Who suggested that Mr. Burns was
a ninny?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Muir</span>: I’m not suggesting that anyone suggested
it. I merely assert that he is not. Mr.
Burns, let me assure you of the confidence of
the assembled company. Gentlemen, I give
you the health of Mr. Robert Burns, and may
his glass never be empty.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[<span class="italic">They drink to the toast boisterously.</span>]<br />
</p>

<p><span class="italic">White</span>: Speech, speech!</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[<span class="italic">He is supported by the rest.</span>]<br />
</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span> (<span class="italic">rising</span>): It is a great honour to be in
your convivial company. They are fools outside,
but we are Solomons, with the perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
fount of wisdom before us. We are the true
ministers of state, for our policy is everlasting.
Love is our law, and drink is our prophet,
and shall we not obey these? I give you
back a toast—Woman and the brimming
bowl—gentlemen!</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[<span class="italic">The toast is honoured.</span>]<br />
</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Mr. Duncan, wake up, sir. Be not
dejected in sleep, Mr. Duncan.</p>

<p><span class="italic">White</span> (<span class="italic">shaking him</span>): Wake up, Shy. Shall
we forget our behaviour before a man of
genius, a man of temperament?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span> (<span class="italic">rousing himself</span>): Ten per cent.?
What’s ten per cent. to me? I’ll not deal
under twelve. Not a guinea under fifteen.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Muir</span>: Behave yourself, Shy. To-morrow
we will be again your devoted clients. To-night
we do not discuss these things.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span>: I beg your pardon, gentlemen. I
fell asleep, and was dreaming of a small
transaction—most negligent of me to mention
it in this company. By no means.</p>

<p><span class="italic">White</span>: A very unpleasant reference, Shy.
When is quarter-day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span>: Don’t allow that to trouble you,
Mr. White. I am always accommodating.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Simpson</span>: Sat ad diem diei malum est.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span>: Most probably you are. But
scholarship has a hungry belly, Mr. Simpson.
I forswore it when I was a swaddler. I stand
for the receipt of custom.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Muir</span>: O nimble Shy, we are not interested
in your biography.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span>: Will you write my biography, Mr.
Burns?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Ogilvie</span>: It is as unwanted as a paunch on a
jockey.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span>: My lord, I ask you, does this pea-and-thimble
man mean to insult me? (<span class="italic">Rising.</span>)
I asked Mr. Burns to write my biography.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Muir</span>: Sit down, Shy, you’re drunk.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span>: I know I’m drunk—I’m pleased
to confess to anybody I’m drunk—</p>

<p><span class="italic">Ogilvie</span>: Drunk and daft, Shylock, sit down.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span>: You stable-fly, you tap-sawdust,
you ninepenny wager—he owes me four
pounds ten—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">White</span> (<span class="italic">pulling him down</span>): Sit down, Shy,
don’t be a fool. A song, Mr. Burns.</p>

<p><span class="italic">The Others</span>: A song, a song.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Shall gentlemen of spirit quarrel
about four pound ten? Call it quits, Mr.
Duncan.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Muir</span>: Come, Shy, quits, in honour of Mr.
Burns. Sam meant no offence.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span>: I honour Mr. Burns highly. But
I’ll see him damned before I will stand out of
four pound ten.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Simpson</span>: A very ignoble sentiment.</p>

<p><span class="italic">White</span>: A song, a song.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: I’m sorry, Mr. Ogilvie, that our
friend will not oblige us. But was ever
candour more becoming? A song for you,
gentlemen.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Simpson</span>: A very sweet measure, Mr.

would most unconsciously have approved.
And he who has not the expedition of
the ancients is a blockhead.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Muir</span>: A damned blockhead, dominie.
That’s what Mr. Burns called the minister at
lunch to-day. I never heard a compliment
more prettily put. A damned blockhead.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Duncan</span> (<span class="italic">rousing from his stupor</span>): Who says
I’m a damned blockhead? I resent the insults
of this company—I am tired of them.
If Mr. Burns says I am a damned blockhead,
he’s a bankrupt bastard.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Simpson and White</span>: Order, order.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Muir</span> (<span class="italic">a little sobered</span>): Shy Duncan, be

<p><span class="italic">Muir</span> (<span class="italic">with authority now</span>): Drop it, Duncan,
I tell you. Sam is our gillie of all games.
You’re our financier. We know our obligations.
Very well. But you must apologise to

Either that, or you can go home, and

<p><span class="italic">Willie</span>: What’s the use of putting me off like
that? There’s no offence in what I say. I
mean it friendly. The master’s mind is not in
it. This could be a grand farm, Mrs. Burns,
but it needs a judicious industry. He’s a
great man, and a poet, and all that they say,
but here’s a hundred acres being spoilt by his
neglect.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[<span class="smcap">Burns</span> <span class="italic">comes in</span>.]<br />
</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: You’re quite right, Willie, neglect,
that’s what it is.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: You shouldn’t speak so, Willie.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: But he should, Jean, my girl.
Truth’s truth, eh, Willie?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Willie</span>: It’s no good taking it so easy, Mr.
Burns, thinking you’ll make me quiet by
agreeing with me like that. I’ve started, and
I’ll finish. It’s been growing in me. We work
here for a scant of wages—that’s all fair
enough—you can’t afford more. But we
want to have a pride in the place, same as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
ought to, and don’t. And you can laugh at
my truth as you call it, but you feel it all the
same. I’ve watched you, and I’ve seen the
conscience in your face. You stand down in
the fields there like a man moonstruck, when
you ought to be keeping your eyes on us.
Couldn’t you write your poems on Sabbath
afternoons? And you take too much of the
liquor. There’s the stuff in Town meadows
rotting, we’ve missed the last two Dumfries
markets, and there’s a good deal at M’Pherson’s
going begging. Now I’ve said my say,
and you can turn me off. But I couldn’t
watch it with my mouth shut any longer.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[<span class="italic">He goes out to the yard.</span>]<br />
</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Willie Campbell is forgetting himself.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: No, Jean, he’s right. You know it,
and I know it. It isn’t the farm only that’s
spoiling.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: I know, Robbie. Can’t you—I
mean, it’s hard for you.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: It’s hard for you, lass. I’ve got a
head often enough damned well full of resolutions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
but what’s the good of them—they
scatter. The land’s mean and it’s beaten me.
Or I’ve beaten myself. I can’t help the tunes
running in my head, or getting a dry gullet.
(<span class="italic">He goes to the dresser and mixes a bowl of
whisky punch.</span>) But I’ve done with the cursed
bit of acres. I’ve accepted the excise job at
Dumfries.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Accepted it?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Aye—we’ll be more certain there.
Seventy pounds a year. (<span class="italic">Drinking.</span>) We’re
famous, Jean, and now we have preferment.
The muse is honoured. We should give
thanks.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: And there were such fine promises
too, from Edinburgh and the like.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Solicitation—well, there, I’ve had
no stomach for it. I’ll not complain.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Couldn’t you see M’Pherson?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Aye—I’ve been meaning to this
fortnight. But you know how it is. I’m all
moods these days. That’s no reason—I
know where the reproach lies well enough.
But if it weren’t for you, Jean girl, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the others, I’d take my songs to the devil
point to point. I’d have done with disillusions
then. I could spread my wings in hell,
maybe.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Don’t talk so, Robbie. Is my faith in
you nothing?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: It’s a miracle of your own heart.
But there—Dumfries may mend us. (<span class="italic">Drinking.</span>)
To the providence of Dumfries.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: And you’ll see M’Pherson?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Burns</span>: Aye. And I’m weak and unstable, I
know, but I know where my good fortune is,
for all I’m careless of it at times. You’ve been
in my mind all day. Listen.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Yes, Mrs. Fergus. Come in and sit
down.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span> (<span class="italic">sitting</span>): A fine, thrifty evening.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: The season’s very prosperous.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: I hope you find it so.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: We’ve much to be thankful for.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: You’re a great one for fortitude,
Mrs. Burns, I’ll say that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: I don’t know how that may be.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: My husband says your farm
isn’t showing as well as it might. Mr. Burns is
busy elsewhere no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: He’s been doing a bit of excise work.
He’s going to take it up altogether. In
Dumfries.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: In Dumfries? But that makes
company for him, I daresay.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: A man must need a strong
constitution, what with a call here, and a call
there. But Mr. Burns looks a stout sort.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: He’s very popular—with his fame
too.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: Quite a celebrity, I suppose,
when he’s away from home.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Some of our neighbours appreciate
him too.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: And not the handsome ones
least, Mrs. Burns, I’ll be bound.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: So he tells me.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: You’re not very partial to observation
yourself, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: When your man’s a man of spirit,
Mrs. Fergus, you can see and you can not see.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: Well, every woman must
judge for herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Some judge for others as well.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: Do you find Ramsay’s mill
satisfactory? We thought of trying it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: I’ve not heard Robert mention it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: Indeed? I thought he did a
good deal of business there. I see him going
down often.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: He doesn’t always trouble me with
these things.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: Ramsay’s daughter Peg is
growing into the flower of the countryside
they say, and none too particular either.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Listen, Mrs. Fergus. You called in
here neighbourly, and you’re welcome. But I
know more than you can teach me about
Robert, and I’ll ask you to take your gossip
where it’s wanted. He’s no pattern maybe,
but there’s few with the heart or the brain to
copy him. There’s that in him that is beyond
the understanding of the likes of us. I’ve had
my share of him, and I know how to keep my
share of him. And I’d rather have that share
than ten other whole men. And when I want
to take counsel about him I’ll take counsel
with him himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: If you take my words like
that—</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: Just like that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span> (<span class="italic">rising</span>): Then I’d better be
going.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: No, you needn’t go. You’re welcome,
as I said. There’s plenty else for conversation.
Sit down. Do you know Dumfries?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mrs. Fergus</span>: I’m sure I meant no interfering.
(<span class="italic">Sitting.</span>) A little. It’s a very fashionable
town.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jean</span>: I fear it will be costly.</p>

there.</p>
